            <p>Release Notes summarize the most important changes made to the course with each improvement project. They are intended to help all who teach or work on the course to smoothly adapt to changes and coordinate efforts with historical context.
                Each improvement project should result in an entry below identified by the semester the improvement is first implemented. The most recent release notes should be inserted at the top of the list (like an email strand) to make them most
                visible.</p>
