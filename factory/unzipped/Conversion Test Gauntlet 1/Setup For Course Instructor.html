<h1>Setup For Course Instructor</h1>
<hr />
<h2>General Setup for Instructor</h2>
<p>Complete the <strong>Instructor Pre-Semester Checklist</strong> that Online Instruction emailed to you. You will receive this email shortly before the semester begins. If you feel you should have received the email but have not yet received it, please contact your Teaching Group Leader (TGL).</p>
<p>Ensure that your Instructor Profile is updated with your Office Hours and other information. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on your name in the upper-right corner of I-Learn and then choose "Profile" from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Click the Change Picture button and upload your BYU-I professional photo. It must be a small version of it to fit.</li>
<li>Include other information that you would like your students to see. Under "Homepage," enter your Zoom URL&nbsp;(https://byui.zoom.us/...). Under the Contact Information section, be sure to include your phone number and email address. Students can click your image anywhere in the course and it will bring up your profile page. Likewise, you can do the same for students.</li>
<li>Open your course from the Select a Course drop down menu in the top black minibar, and click in Content. Find the Overview page at the very top of the left hand navigation bar and select it. Click on the content of the page to edit it. It will open a content editor window. Here is your instructor contact card. Update this section of the Overview page with your contact information along with other information you'd like your students to see.</li>

<ul>
<li>A welcome to the class including when the class will start and an explanation of how to access the course.</li>
<li>An invitation to reserve 3-4 hours each week per credit to devote to their studies. Time should be reserved throughout the week to successfully meet course deadlines.</li>
<li>An brief explanation of any unique course characteristics.</li>
<li>An invitation to access the course promptly and what students should do to get started.</li>
<li>Remind students that this is not an independent study course and that they need start right away.</li>
<li>Provide contact information for you including your BYU-Idaho email address (and a phone number, if you want to provide one).</li>
<li>Remind students to use appropriate etiquette and respect in their interactions with instructors and students.</li>
<li><em>Holding an office hour is optional. If you intend to hold an office hour, invite students to attend and provide instruction for how to find your virtual office. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>*Be sure to add your own personal flare to your welcome email. Below is a sample email template which you may find useful.</p>

Please read the course syllabus and schedule for more information about the course and assignments.</p>
<p>Each week, I will hold an office hour on [<em>insert day of week and time, including time zone</em>]. We will be using Zoom.

<p>It is important to get started right away! Begin by reading Activity 02 and Activity 03 in the &ldquo;Course Introduction&rdquo; week. Get to know the course and your classmates. Remember, this is not an independent study course, and you will need to follow the due dates posted online.</p>
<p>I hope each of you knows that even though this is an online course, I am available to answer your questions and concerns.

I will reply to you as soon as I can. As a reminder, remember to use appropriate etiquette as you communicate with your classmates and all of your instructors throughout the semester. Address individuals appropriately and show them respect. You will be much more effective if you use good communication skills.</p>
